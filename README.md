This project implements a complete ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for weather data.
The goal is to collect raw weather data, clean and transform it into a structured format, and then analyze it using SQL and Python.
The process provides insights into temperature trends, humidity levels, rainfall patterns, and overall weather conditions.

ETL Process:
.Extract: Retrieve raw weather data from a source (e.g., CSV or API).
.Transform: Clean the data, handle missing values, and standardize temperature and humidity units.
.Load: Store the transformed data into a PostgreSQL database for efficient querying and analysis

Tools and Technologies:
.Python (Pandas, SQLAlchemy, Jupyter Notebook) – for data transformation and automation.
.PostgreSQL / SQL – for data storage and analytical queries.
.Matplotlib & Seaborn – for data visualization.
