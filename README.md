This project implements a complete **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline for weather data.  
The goal is to collect raw weather data, clean and transform it into a structured format, and then analyze it using SQL and Python.  
The process provides insights into temperature trends, humidity levels, rainfall patterns, and overall weather conditions.  

### 🧩 ETL Process:
- **Extract:** Retrieve raw weather data from a source (e.g., CSV or API).  
- **Transform:** Clean the data, handle missing values, and standardize temperature and humidity units.  
- **Load:** Store the transformed data into a PostgreSQL database for efficient querying and analysis.  

### 🛠️ Tools and Technologies:
- **Python** (Pandas, SQLAlchemy, Jupyter Notebook) – for data transformation and automation.  
- **PostgreSQL / SQL** – for data storage and analytical queries.  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for data visualization.
